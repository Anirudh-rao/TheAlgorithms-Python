# What is an Algorithm?
In this tutorial, we will learn what algorithms are with the help of examples.

In computer programming terms, `an algorithm` is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output. For example,

An algorithm to add two numbers:

1. Take two number inputs

2. Add numbers using the + operator

3. Display the result

### Qualities of a Good Algorithm
1. Input and output should be defined precisely.
2. Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
3. Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
4. An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.


### Data Structure and Types
In this article, you will learn about data structure and its types.

**What are Data Structures?**
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose the right data structure for your project. For example, if you want to store data sequentially in the memory, then you can go for the Array data structure.

**Types of Data Structure**
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

1. Linear data structure
2. Non-linear data structure

Let's learn about each type in detail.

**Linear data structures**
In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

1. **Array Data Structure**
In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type. And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.

2. **Stack Data Structure**
In stack data structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle. That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first.

It works just like a pile of plates where the last plate kept on the pile will be removed first.  

3. **Queue Data Structure**
Unlike stack, the queue data structure works in the FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first.

It works just like a queue of people in the ticket counter where first person on the queue will get the ticket first. 

4. **Linked List Data Structure**
In linked list data structure, data elements are connected through a series of nodes. And, each node contains the data items and address to the next node.


**Non linear data structures**

Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures.

1. **Graph Data Structure**
In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.

Popular Graph Based Data Structures:

1. Spanning Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree
2. Strongly Connected Components
3. Adjacency Matrix
4. Adjacency List


2. **Trees Data Structure**
Similar to a graph, a tree is also a collection of vertices and edges. However, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.

Popular Tree based Data Structure

1. Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree
3. AVL Tree
4. B-Tree
5. B+ Tree
6. Red-Black Tree
